Module README File

Unlike most of the BES modules, this handler for SQL data is a separate project.
It can be added to the bes/modules directory or built outside of the bes software.

To build the code:

autoreconf -fiv
./configure --prefix=<prefix>
make
make check
make install

Notes:
./configure must find both libdap and the BES. It will use the pkgconfig package 
manager and, if that fails, look for dap-config and bes-config on the PATH.

make check doesn't work
