The handler uses files that end in '.sql' as definitions for a
dataset that Hyrax will serve. The sqlite.sql file is used for
the tests and references the 'sqlite_test.db' database. The
connection between the information in the database and the sqlite.sql
file is via the '[from] sqlh_table' entry at the end of the file
and the definition of 'sqlh_table' in the sqlite_sdbc.ini here.

The sqlite_odbc.ini and sqlite_odbcinst.ini files should be copied to
/etc/ or /usr/local/etc/ and renamed odbc.ini and odbcinst.ini, resp.

Other files that are here:
odbc.TEMPLATES.ini: Templates for various databases
sqlh.sql: SQL commands to generate the data in the sqlite_test.db file
test_full.sql, test_full1, test_full2, test_int: These files
show the full syntax supported by the handler.
